**Note:** For the TBMQ 1.2.1 version the installation scripts were updated to start using docker volumes instead of 
bind mounts, Kafka without ZooKeeper (by leveraging KRaft), and some other important changes. As the migration process is too complex in this scope, 
we recommend installing TBMQ from scratch for test deployments. Otherwise, please [contact us](https://github.com/thingsboard/tbmq/issues), so we can answer any questions
and provide our help if needed.

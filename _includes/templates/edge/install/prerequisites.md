## Prerequisites

To start utilizing the ThingsBoard **Edge**, it is essential to have an operational ThingsBoard {{appPrefix}} server that supports Edge functionality.

{% if docsPrefix == 'pe/edge/' %}
{% include templates/edge/obtain-pe-cloud.md %}
{% else %}
{% include templates/edge/obtain-ce-cloud.md %}
{% endif %}

{% include templates/edge/install/hardware-requirements.md %}

### Provisioning a new Edge instance on the ThingsBoard server

Additionally, you will need to provision **Edge** on the ThingsBoard server.

{% if docsPrefix == 'pe/edge/' %}
{% assign addEdge = '

        title: Enter a name for your edge. For instance, "My New Edge". If necessary, update the cloud endpoint. This URL should be accessible from the edge. If the edge is running in a Docker container, using "localhost" is <b>incorrect</b>. It must be the IP address of the machine where ThingsBoard <b>PE</b> is running and accessible by the edge container. If you are using the ThingsBoard <b>Cloud</b> server to evaluate the edge, leave this setting as it is. Click "Add" to confirm adding your new Edge.

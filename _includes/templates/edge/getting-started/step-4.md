We will create a dashboard on the <b>ThingsBoard Community Edition</b> server, and add both a table and a chart widget to view temperature data on the Server and on the Edge. 
Please see the instructions below.

To add the table widget, select it from the widget library, where widgets are organized into bundles. 
Each widget is associated with a data source, which determines the data it displays.

Device provisioning from the Edge to the Server is automatic, requiring no additional actions. 
Once a device is created on the Edge, it will be automatically published to the ThingsBoard server.

To view the provisioned device, please open **{{currentThingsBoardVersion}}** by visiting **SERVER_URL**.

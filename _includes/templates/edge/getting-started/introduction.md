The aim of this tutorial is to guide you through the fundamental usage of the most widely-used features of ThingsBoard Edge. Throughout this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Connect local devices, such as sensors, to ThingsBoard Edge;
- Provision sensors from ThingsBoard Edge to the {{currentThingsBoardVersion}} server;
- Transmit data from sensors to ThingsBoard Edge and further propagate this data to the {{currentThingsBoardVersion}} server;
- Construct real-time end-user dashboards in the cloud and provision them to the Edge.

To maintain simplicity, in this guide we will connect and visualize data from a temperature sensor.
